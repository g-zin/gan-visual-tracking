Generative Adversarial Networks for Online Visual Object Tracking Systems

Introduction: 
This project is to build visual object tracking benchmark using generative adversarial networks to track any moving target in a sequence without prior traning on the target.

This implemntation is based on mdnet vital and rtmdnet. 
I modify the architecture of the baseline to get MDGanet, ROIAL-MDNet, MDResNet and MDResGaNet.
